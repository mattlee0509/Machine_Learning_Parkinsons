We aim to develop a statistical model to predict the progression of Parkinson’s disease, quantified by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Trained medical professionals typically assess the UPDRS in a clinical setting. Specifically, the motor UPDRS score, which measures motor impairment, is an important aspect of this scale.
